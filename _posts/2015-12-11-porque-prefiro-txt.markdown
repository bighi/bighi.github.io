I've used many different apps to organize my notes and documents. I've used [Simplenote][simplenote], [Evernote][evernote], [Google Docs][googledocs], and many others. And every time I end up coming back to the simplest solution of all: plain text files inside a document folder.

It doesn't matter how advanced technology is, sometimes the best solution is the simplest one. You may disagree now, but keep reading while I explain what problem I'm trying to solve and why plain text is the best solution.

## The problem ##

All the apps I mentioned above have one or both of these problems: proprietary formats, and files are not saved on your computer.

The problem with proprietary formats is that it can only be read by one (or a few) specific apps. If the app (or server) stops existing for whatever reason, all the information stored there is gone. Or I may end up having to pay a heavy price to convert it.

I've seen posts about people that found old files from years ago and couldn't read it because it was saved in a dead file format, be it WordStar, an ancient version of Excel or Apple Pages.

One the format is left behind, goodbye. And if that app doesn't have a mobile version, you won't be able to get your notes while away from a computer.

And the problem with files that are saved *on the cloud* instead of your computer is that it's not under **your** control. If the service changes to a recurring payment, you're screwed. If the server shuts down (temporarily or permanently), you're screwed. If the company goes bankrupt or acquired, you're screwed.

If you like automating stuff (like I do), not having access to the files is also a big problem.

## The solution: plain text + Dropbox ##

Plain text files are a decades old technology. And they will still be available for decades to come. There's no weird code behind them, it's just unicode text inside a file. And, well... text is going away anytime soon.

**Any information that I save in a plain text file I will be able to read as long as I still have the file, even if it's 40 years from now and I'm in a nursery home using my old man's holographic iPhone**.

I save all my notes inside a Documents directory. To be able to read those notes on any computer, I sync it with [Dropbox][dropbox].

It doesn't matter where I am, or what device I'm using, I can always check any information that I've saved, or edit any note. Worst case scenario, I go to the Dropbox web site and check the files there.

And even if Dropbox disappears from the world **right now**, all my files are saved on all my computers, and my phone and I won't lose a thing.

On my next post I will explain better how I organize all my notes and tasks in plain text, because this post is already too big.
