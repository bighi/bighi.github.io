New blog. Again.

I have created and abandoned many blogs in the latest years. These days I feel sad for not keeping them (it would be nice to look back to how I used to think years ago). Now I've decided to try one more time.

I'll try a different tactic here: I'm going to post smaller posts, with increased frequency and less self censorship. And the themes are going to be... well, basically anything I want to write about.

These are the themes that motivate me these days:

- Video games
- Quantified Self
- Web and mobile development
- Automation of stuff
- Writing
- Brazilian politics

This time, instead of abandoning this blog after a few months or a year, I'm going to keep it for years. Many years. This time I want to be able to look back and remember what I was learning, or thinking, or planning, whatever.

If I make 1 or 2 posts a week, I'm satisfied.
