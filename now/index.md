Derek Sivers had an interesting idea: that bloggers create a page about
what they're doing now. This page came from that idea.

I'm going to try to keep this page as updated as I can. I hope I can automate
this in the near future.

## Books ##

At the moment I'm reading [**So Good They Can't Ignore you**][book] by
Cal Newport.

This is a very interesting nonfiction book about not following your
passion. The hypothesis of the book is that we got this figured out
backwards. First you get good at something, and *then* you love it.

## Games ##

I haven't been playing that much. But when I play, I'm split between
these two games:

- Cities: Skylines (PC)
- Heroes of the Storm (PC)

## TV Shows ##

I've been watching the second season of **House of Cards**. Yes, I know I'm
late. But I'm loving it.

## Projects ##

My main project for the past month has been the board game blog [**Regras do Jogo**][regrasjogo], that I'm writing in Portuguese.

I'm also learning AngularJS and the ionic Framework to created a series
of pc and mobile apps focused on plain text. More about that soon.
