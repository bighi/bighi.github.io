Hi, my name is Leonardo Bighi and I'm a web developer from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

I make software mostly with Ruby and JavaScript, but sometimes I dabble in other languages like C or Python.

I'm also interested in free software, 3D printing, video games and books.

Someday in the future I might expand this into a proper About page. I'm not a big fan of social networks, but you can find me on Bluesky as @bighi.

Take a look at the hardware and software I use: [What I use](/what-i-use/)
