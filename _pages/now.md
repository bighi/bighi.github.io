Derek Sivers had an interesting idea: that bloggers create a page about
what they're doing now. This page came from that idea.

I'm going to try to keep this page as updated as I can. I hope I can automate
this in the near future.

## Books

Unfortunately, I haven't read any book recently.

But I'm planning on reading **Dungeon Crawler Carl** and **Kings of the Wyld**.

## Games

I have been ignoring my PS5 and playing on my Switch 2 and Steam Deck. These are the games that I've been playing lately:

- Cities: Skylines (this was on my list in 2020 and is still here!)
- Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
- Mass Effect 1 (Legendary Edition)
- Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time

## TV Shows

Currently watching or recently watched:

- Invasion, season 1
- Pluribus, season 1
- Slow Horses, season 5

## Projects

Soon
