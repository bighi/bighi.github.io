Derek Sivers had an interesting idea: that bloggers create a page about
what they're doing now. This page came from that idea.

I'm going to try to keep this page as updated as I can. I hope I can automate
this in the near future.

## Books ##

At the moment I'm reading Rhythm of War, by Brandon Sanderson.

This is the fourth book in the Stormlight Archive series. And probably the best fantasy series I've ever read.

## Games ##

I haven't been playing that much. But when I play, I'm usually playing one of those:

- Cities: Skylines
- Slay The Spire
- Chess (just regular chess)

## TV Shows ##

Currently watching:

- We Are Who We Are
- Silicon Valley


## Projects ##

Soon
