This is a small list of the hardware I use.

## Computers

The laptop I carry with me everywhere is my **Lenoxo Thinkpad X230**. Old, but awesome. This thing can probably survive an atomic bomb, and is good enough to me. It has 8gb RAM, and a 120GB SSD that I installed. Do you remember how great it was when we could fix and upgrade our own computers?

I have another laptop, and this one is much more powerful. It's an Avell (it's a Brazilian brand) with 32GB RAM, 1TB HDD, 512GB SSD, 16GB Intel Optane memory. It also has a GTX 1660 Ti graphics card, so this is also my main gaming machine. The battery on this thing only lasts an hour, so I never take it off the office desk it's on. I work here when I want to sit at a proper desk.

I also have a Raspberry Pi 3 hidden behind my living room TV. It runs Home Assistant, Miniflux, a DNS server, Syncthing and Node-RED.

## Gaming Consoles

My only gaming console at the moment is the **Nintendo Switch**. I love how portable it is, and I don't need ultra high quality graphics. I only care if the game is fun.

I had a Playstation 4 that I sold in 2019 to buy a used Xbox One. And in November 2020 I sold that Xbox too.

## Phone(s)

I currently have two phones.

My main phone at the moment is an **iPhone 11**. No matter how much I try to get away from Apple, iOS is miles ahead of Android in almost everything. But I don't use many Apple services, I try to avoid being locked up in their platform.

I also have an Android phone: a **Samsung Galaxy S10+**. I'm trying to sell it online, but while it doesn't happen I use it to do some comparisons between iOS and Android when doing some tasks.
