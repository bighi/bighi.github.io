This is a small list of the hardware I use.

The first time I wrote this was in 2020. Now I'm updating this list in 2025, and things are very different.

## Computers

The laptop I carry with me everywhere is my **16" M3 Max Macbook Pro**. This computer is much more powerful than I need, and can handle everything I throw at it. It has 36GB and 1TB of storage.

I use my Macbook with a 32" 4K Monitor from Samsung. But I might replace it with a 5K monitor in 2026.

I also have a Raspberry Pi 3 hidden behind my living room TV. It runs Home Assistant, Miniflux, a DNS server, Syncthing and Node-RED.

And I have a gaming desktop computer running Kubuntu. I built it many years ago, with a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and an nVidia RTX 2060 GPU, and 32GB of RAM. Still good enough for what I need, and I play a lot on it. Maybe in 2026 I'll finally replace it with a newer and more powerful gaming computer.

## Gaming Consoles

When I wrote this in 2020, the only gaming console I had was the **Nintendo Switch**. But now in 2025 the situation is very different. Now I think that I have too many gaming consoles.

I still have my Nintendo Switch, but now I also have the **Nintendo Switch 2**. I play a lot on the Switch 2, because I love portable consoles. I prefer to play games on my balcony, or the bedroom, or whatever. I might sell the Switch 1, or maybe jailbreak it.

I also have a **Playstation 5**. But I don't use it that much, and I'm thinking about selling it.

And I have a **Steam Deck** to play PC games in a portable device. I think this is the second console I use the most. I have a huge backlof of games on Steam, and even the games I got on the PS5 I'm thinking of buying on Steam just to play on the Deck.

## Phone

I had two phones in 2020 (iPhone and Android), but now in 2025 I only have the base **iPhone 16**. It's more than enough for my needs, and I might keep it for 2 or 3 more years, if I don't drop it.

## Other devices

Of the other devices I have, one of the most important is the **Airdrops Pro 2**. Not only as a earphones, but also to use them as hearing aids, because I have a hearing disability. They are awesome hearing aids, even better than lots of dedicated devices you can buy. The only problem with the Airpods Pro is that the battery doesn't last very long. About 4 hours at most, sometimes a little bit less.

I also have proper hearing aids from Phonak. I forgot the name of the model. The battery lasts for about 18 hours, which is enough for a whole day. They can be used just like bluetooth earphones, so I can listen to music or podcasts from my iPhone while I wear them. But they cost 16x times more the Airpods Pro, and the audio is worse. If I could use the Airpods Pro for an entire day, I wouldn't even need hearing aids. Specially because I have more control over the Airpods than the Phonak device I have.

And last but not least, my beloved 3D printer from Bambulab. It's a Bambulab P1S, with AMS on the side. I can use up to 4 colors while 3D printing, and this printer is very precise and prints rarely fail. It's far from the cheapest model, but to me it's worth it. I print a few things for the house every month, and I've printed A LOT of scenery for my tabletop RPG sessions. It's one of the best devices I got the last few years, and I can't see myself without a 3D printer anymore.
